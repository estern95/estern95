Hi, I'm Eric! I use he/him/his pronouns and I am data scientist currently working in Boudler Colorado. I currently work in the clean tech industry, using machine learning and statistics to help companies save on energy and better retain customers through efficiency programs. Beyond that, I am a clean code fanatic, obsesive learner, and future cat owner.
